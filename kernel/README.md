# /kernel — the commerce kernel

The 15 kernel components defined in [`docs/MODULE_MAP.md`](../docs/MODULE_MAP.md) §3. One
directory per component, named by the `dir` slug registered in
[`platform/architecture/manifest.ts`](../platform/architecture/manifest.ts).

**Nothing here is implemented.** Build steps B-1 through B-3 populate this directory.

Two rules are enforced by `npm run check:boundaries`:

- **Kernel purity.** A kernel component may import only other kernel components and
  `platform/`. It may never depend on a business module, the design system or an app. A kernel
  component that "needs" a business module is a misplaced business rule — move the rule out of
  the kernel (MODULE_MAP §10.6).
- **Registration.** A directory here that is absent from the architecture manifest fails the
  check, because its layer is unknown and its imports therefore cannot be verified.

`kernel/ai-gateway` (K-13) is the single component permitted to import a model-provider SDK.
